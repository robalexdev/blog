I've been getting back into blogging and am happy to share that my next group of blog posts will be a collection.

When I write I often end up with a massive amount of content.
I have a hard time keeping posts focused on a single theme; writing is thinking and there's just so many fun angles to ponder!
As a post is polished for publication, I trim sections to the "cutting room floor".

This time I had trouble letting go, and I spun a couple blog posts out.
Presented here in no particular order and on no particular schedule.

## UUID collection

This collection covers UUIDs, especially collisions, guessability, and implementation quirks.
